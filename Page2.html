    <h2>I will be talking about YouTube</h2>
    <p>What I have learn from YouTube, oen of the inporrted thing you need to know has a new channel is that if you upload good videos for lets say 10 days in a row and you get 100+ subs and 10k+ viwes, like 500 of thoses viwes may have liked your videos. So why is this inported well if you stop uploading videos for lets say 5+ days, it's liek your youtube channel being shot by a gun and the videos you are uploading is it's daily actints and stoping uploading is youtube forgeting you and so when you start uploading again it dosen't give your videos out has must and you have to redo the possis but with more people there when you restart</p>
